# Magic-Crystal-Ball-with-JavaScript

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a challenge I worked on in JavaScript. It has two parts:
The <strong>first</strong> part is a script that tells a user to pick a number, then assigns them a fortune from the "oracle", based on the number.

The <strong>second</strong> one uses the Math.random method to generate any random number and rounds it to the nearest whole number with the Math.floor method. It then generates a random fortune as well.
